title: "Quantum Simulation"
summary: > 
    Conducted numerical simulations of quantum state transport in superconducting microwave cavity systems using QuTiP, focusing on mode decomposition and spectral analysis. Investigated time-dependent output spectra of nonlinear and linear resonators, analyzing photon emission, mode occupation, and Kerr effects under varying conditions.
