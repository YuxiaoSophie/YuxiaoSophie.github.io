I built a VR interface in Unity3D simulating underwater missions for scuba divers, supporting real-time communication, navigation, and monitoring of oxygen level, battery, and depth. I also implemented hand-tracking and heads-up display interactions on Meta Quest 2 to enable gesture-based control and information access in dynamic underwater environments
