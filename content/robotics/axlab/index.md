title: "Buoyancé: Reeling Helium-Inflated Balloons with Mobile Robots on the Ground for Mid-Air Tangible Display, Interaction, and Assembly"
summary: > 
    Designed and developed **Buoyancé**, a spatially actuated system that integrates mobile reeling robots with helium-inflated balloons to enable mid-air tangible interaction, spatial visualization, and constructive assembly.  

    This work culminated in a full paper **accepted to UIST 2025**, along with a poster presented at the 2025 Undergraduate Research Symposium at UChicago.

My contribution included the development of an innovative spatially actuated tangible user interface that combines a coordinated multi-robot system with helium-inflated balloons via a reeling mechanism. The work involved co-designing wheeled robots, co-implementing software and hardware solutions, and leveraging a motion-tracking system to enable precise control of both robots and balloons. 

Recognizing the need for interactivity and autonomy, I extended the system by developing a control framework supporting six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) manipulation, incorporating techniques such as human body mapping and gesture-based tracking. These robots were then applied to various scenarios, including tangible interaction and assistive room reconfiguration, demonstrating their adaptability across different tasks. 

During testing, operating multiple robots in human environments often led to collisions. To address this, I further integrated obstacle-avoidance algorithms, enabling the robots to safely navigate environments with static obstacles such as chairs and tables, as well as dynamic obstacles like people and other robots.
